# Overview

## Motivation
> Modern 3D vision advancements rely on data driven methods and thus, task specific annotated datasets.
> Especially for geometric inference tasks like depth and surface estimation, the collection of high quality data is very challenging, expensive and laborious.
> While considerable efforts have been made for traditional pinhole cameras, the same cannot be said for omnidirectional ones.
> Our __3D60<sup>o</sup>__ dataset fills a very important gap in data-driven spherical 3D vision and namely for monocular and stereo dense depth and surface estimation.
> _We originate by exploiting the efforts made in providing synthetic and real scanned 3D datasets of interior spaces and re-using them via ray-tracing in order to generate high quality, densely annotated spherical panoramas._

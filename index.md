# Motivation
* data-drive 3d vision
* lack of densely data
* self-supervised or unsupervised

## Omnidirectional 3D Vision
* even harder to collect data (sensors, cost, no-depth)
* tough to collect stereo data
* only video for self- or unsupervised

## 3D Scenes
* however we have 3D datasets
* buildings/scans/indoors
* real/synthetic

## Concept
* re-use the 3D dataset efforts
* synthesize 360 data
* ray-casting
* color, depth, normals, stereo

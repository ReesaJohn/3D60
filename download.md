The __3D60__ dataset is split in three parts, each one representing a different viewpoint (_i.e._ left/down/center, right and up), and each one containing all three available modalities (_i.e._ color image, depth and normal maps)

Each part is uploaded on Zenodo as a distinct repository and thus, for each part a separate access request needs to be made on the respective Zenodo repository using the links below:

 - Central (_i.e._ Left or Down): 
 - Right: 
 - Up:

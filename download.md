# 3D60 Repositories

The __3D60__ dataset is split in three parts, each one representing a different viewpoint (_i.e._ left/down/center, right and up), and each one containing all three available modalities (_i.e._ color image, depth and normal maps)

Each part is uploaded on Zenodo as a distinct repository and thus, for each part a separate access request needs to be made on the respective Zenodo repository using the links below:


|__Viewpoint__|__Zenodo repository__|
|:---:|:---:|
|Central (_i.e._ Left/Down)|[Central Viewpoint Request Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3407840#.XX06KygzaUk)|
|Right|[Right Viewpoint Request Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3407875#.XX08HCgzaUk)|
|Up|[Up Viewpoint Request Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3408441#.XX1QWCgzaUk)|



Please note that __before__ performing the request, make sure that you have correctly filled in the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ikJW2QU88GDahEBr6) accepting the licencing conditions of each 3D dataset.

**Real Domain Only Version**: A real domain only version is now also available in [Real Domain Only Request Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3492155#.XagQA-gzaUk). This version includes only the samples from Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D, skipping the entire SunCG dataset. It also contains all modalities (_i.e._ color, depth and normal information) and all stereo viewpoints (_i.e._ center, right and up) bundled up in a single Zenodo repository. The same process applies, first the Google Form needs to be filled in and then a request can be made to the Zenodo repository.
